# Team Profile Generator

## Objective
The objective was to use node.js, npm inquirer, and npm jest to create a team profile generator using object oriented programming and test driven development.

## Approach
I began by reading over the criteria and writing out all that I would need including the file structure. I took parts that I was comfortable with and could understand and then pieced them together after watching several tutorials online about classes and constructors and running tests. It all came together in the end and I was able to have passing tests but please read Reflection section.

## End Result
The final result is exactly what was required within the challenge specs. I am happy to complete this and prove to myself I could do it (with help) although it was challenging.

## Reflection
Following my usual reflection after a challenge completion, I realized I did not fully understand the criteria before I began coding. It is my downfall to continue to keep jumping into projects without a well thought out and written gameplan, and problem solving mindframe. I think this is because of the stress of time and maybe that I am not as good at handling stress as I thought. It is something I will continue to work on - to be a good problem solver and coder.
